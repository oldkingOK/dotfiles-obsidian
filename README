dotfiles-obsidian
=================
My configuration of Obsidian, provide the init scripts for installing plugins and configurations of both plugin and Obsidian.

Use same plugins and configurations among all vaults by soft link everything.


Installation
------------
Create a new vault. It's not recommend that use an old vault because the soft link will override the plugins and settings etc.

Make sure that and `python3-requests` exists in system.

    git clone git@github.com:oldkingOK/dotfiles-obsidian.git
    cd dotfiles-obsidian
    python3 sync-plugin.py

Then cd to the new obsidian repo root path which contains .obsidian folder, excute /this/repo/deploy, and follow the corresponding instructions.


Notes
-----

- Remember check plugins update once in a while.
- Deploy again if you moved this repo
